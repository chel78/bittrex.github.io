If there are no request contents, populate this header with a SHA512 hash of an empty string.\n\nSample JS Code Snippet:\n\n``` javascript\nvar contentHash = CryptoJS.SHA512(content).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);\n```\n\nExample Value:\n\n``` markdown\ncf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3e\n```\n\n---\n #### Api-Subaccount-Id (Only for subaccount feature) \n(NOTE: This functionality is limited to partners and unavailable to general traders.)\n\nIf you wish to make a request on behalf of a subaccount, you will need to:\n\n1. Authenticate using all 4 of the headers above referring to your master account.\n2. Populate the Api-Subaccount-Id header with the UUID of the subaccount you wish to impersonate for this request. The specified subaccount *must* be a subaccount of the master account used to authenticate the request.\n3. Include the Api-Subaccount-Id header at the end of the pre-signed signature, as indicated in the next section.\n\nExample Value:\n\n`x111x11x-8968-48ac-b956-x1x11x111111`\n\n---\n #### Api-Signature\nCreate a pre-sign string formed from the following items and concatenating them together:\n1. Contents of your `Api-Timestamp` header\n2. The full URI you are using to make the request (including query string)\n3. The HTTP method of the request, in all caps (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.)  \n4. Contents of your `Api-Content-Hash` header \n5. Content of your `Api-Subaccount-Id` header (or an empty string if not present) \n\n\nOnce you have created this pre-sign string, sign it via HmacSHA512, using your API secret as the signing secret. Hex-encode the result of this operation and populate the `Api-Signature` header with it.\n\n\nSample JS Code Snippet:\n\n``` javascript\nvar uri = 'https://api.bittrex.com/v3/balances';\nvar preSign = [timestamp, uri, method, contentHash, subaccountId].join('');\nvar signature = CryptoJS.HmacSHA512(preSign, apiSecret).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);\n```\n\nExample Pre-Signed Value (no subaccount)\n\n``` markdown\n1542323450016https://api.bittrex.com/v3/balancesGETcf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3e\n```\n\nExample Pre-Signed Value (with subaccount)\n\n``` markdown\n1542323450016https://api.bittrex.com/v3/balancesGETcf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3ex111x11x-8968-48ac-b956-x1x11x111111\n```\n\nExample Post-Signed Value:\n\n``` markdown\n939047623f0efbe10bfbb32f18e5d8885b2a91be3c3cea82adf0dd2d20892b20bcb6a10a91fec3afcedcc009f2b2a86c5366974cfadcf671fe0490582568f51f\n```\n\n\n",

These list API methods share a common structure, using at least these three parameters: `pageSize, nextPageToken and previousPageToken.` These parameters, if necessary are specified as query parameters on the HTTP request.\n\n ### Arguments:\n\n\n\n - __pageSize(optional)__: A limit on the number of objects to be returned between 1 and 200, defaults to 100\n - __nextPageToken(optional)__: The id of the last item on the current page. This is used for defining the starting point of the next page. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects ending with objFoo, your subsequent call can include `nextPageToken=objFoo's id` in order to fetch the next page of the list starting after objFoo.\n\n - __previousPageToken(optional)__: The id of the first item on the current page. This is used for defining the ending point of the previous page. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects starting with objBar, your subsequent call can include `previousPageToken=objBar's id` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.\n\n\n ### Examples:\n\nList withdrawals, in reverse chronological order, up to maximum of 20 withdrawals, starting at the most recent withdrawal created:\n\n`https://api.bittrex.com/v3/withdrawals?pageSize=20`\n\nList withdrawals, in reverse chronological order, up to maximum of 10 withdrawals, starting after the withdrawal with ID of `940af3c3-665d-4432-a12e-cdf8fd99ab3b`\n\n`https://api.bittrex.com/v3/withdrawals?pageSize=10&nextPageToken=940af3c3-665d-4432-a12e-cdf8fd99ab3b`\n\n List withdrawals, in reverse chronological order, up to a maximum of 10 withdrawals, ending before the withdrawal with ID of `0d990dd2-4103-4d57-8e80-047e886537db`: \n\n`https://api.bittrex.com/v3/withdrawals?pageSize=10&previousPageToken=0d990dd2-4103-4d57-8e80-047e886537db`\n\n",

            "description": "Orders are placed using the [POST /orders](#operation--orders-post) operation. You can find sample request bodies for different types of orders in the examples in this section.\n\n### __Order Types__\n\n - __Market Order__ : An order to buy or sell a specified quantity of an asset immediately at the best available price. The market order will consume available orders on the book as it executes. Consequently, especially for large orders, the average price at which the order is filled will deviate from the last-traded price or current quote.\n\n - __Limit Order__ : An order to trade a specified quantity of an asset at a specified price. A buy order will only be filled at or below the limit price and a sell order will only be filled at or above the limit price.\n\n - __Ceiling Order__ : A market or limit order that allows you to specify the amount of quote currency you want to spend (or receive, if selling) instead of the quantity of the market currency (e.g. buy $100 USD of BTC at the current market BTC price)\n\n - __Good-Til-Cancelled Order__ : The order remains in force until it is explicitly cancelled either by the user or by Bittrex \n\n - __Immediate-Or-Cancel Order__ : The order will be filled immediately as much as possible and then cancelled.\n\n - __Fill-or-Kill__ : The order will be filled immediately and completely, or it is cancelled without being filled at all.\n\n - __Post Only__ : This option allows market makers to ensure that their orders are making it to the order book instead of matching with a pre-existing order. Note: If the order is not a maker order, you will return an error and the order will be cancelled\n\n - __Conditional Order__ : A directive for the system to place an order on your behalf when the price on the market moves past a given threshold. These are treated separately from orders. Refer to the Placing Conditional Orders section for more information. \n\n\n ### __Order types and time in force__ \n\n The following table shows which time in force options apply to which order types.\n\n\n<div style='overflow-x:auto;'><table><tbody><tr><th>timeInForce</th><th>LIMIT</th><th>MARKET</th><th>CEILING_LIMIT</th><th>CEILING_MARKET</th></tr><tr><td>GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td></tr><tr><td>IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td></tr><tr><td>FILL_OR_KILL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td></tr><tr><td>POST_ONLY_GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td></tr></tbody></table></div> \n\n\n ### __clientOrderId__ \n\nAn optional UUID which is generated by the user to to keep a track of the order. If the outcome of placing an order is not known (for example due to a client-side crash that occurred while placing the order), the same order can be safely placed again using the same UUID as the clientOrderId. If the order was received and processed the first time, the API will return an error that includes the existing order's id instead of creating a second order. This protection is in place for 24 hours after an order is placed. Although clientOrderIds which are more than 24 hours old are no longer checked against new orders, they remain associated with their orders as metadata and may be retrieved by clients.\n\n",

        "Placing Conditional Orders": {
            "description": "### Placing Conditional Orders\n\nConditional orders are placed using this API by specifying the market price trigger conditions and what action to take when the trigger is reached. When a trade occurs on the market that matches the trigger conditions, the actions are triggered such as placing an order. Conditional orders are not the same as orders. They are stored separately from normal orders and do not appear on the order book. As such, there is a small delay between trading occurring on the market and corresponding conditional orders being triggered.\n\nCare must also be taken when working with conditional orders because balance is not reserved. If you create a conditional order costing an amount in excess of your account balance for a currency or if your account balance drops due to other trades subsequent to you placing a conditional order there is a risk that you will not have enough balance available to place the order when the conditional order’s condition is met. If this occurs, placement of the order will fail.\n\n#### Trigger conditions\n\nThe trigger for a conditional order is made up of two parts: the operand and the trigger price or percentage. Operand may be either less than or equal to (LTE) or greater than or equal to (GTE). triggerPrice will be compared to the price of the last trade on the market to determine if the action(s) specified in the conditional order should be executed. Alternately, a trailingStopPercent may be specified. This will cause the triggerPrice to float a fixed percent off from the smallest or largest price seen since the conditional order was placed. The below table summarizes these options:\n\n\n<div style='overflow-x:auto;'><table><tbody><tr><th>Parameter provided</th><th>Operand</th><th>Trigger Price</th><th>Triggers when</th></tr><tr><td>triggerPrice</td><td>LTE</td><td>Constant</td><td>A trade occurs at a price LTE the provided trigger price</td></tr><tr><td>triggerPrice</td><td>GTE</td><td>Constant</td><td>A trade occurs at a price GTE the provided trigger price</td></tr><tr><td>trailingStopPercent</td><td>LTE</td><td>Calculated to be trailingStopPercent less than the maximum trade price on the market since the conditional order was placed</td><td>A trade occurs at a price LTE the calculated trigger price</td></tr><tr><td>trailingStopPercent</td><td>GTE</td><td>Calculated to be trailingStopPercent more than the minimum trade price on the market since the conditional order was placed</td><td>A trade occurs at a price GTE the calculated trigger price</td></tr></tbody></table></div> \n\n\n#### Actions\n\nWhen the trigger condition is met, this will result in a new order being placed and, optionally, another order or conditional order being cancelled. The order to place is configured by populating orderToCreate with the same object you would post to create an order. There are some limitations: post only orders, awards, and clientOrderId are not supported. For idempotency, instead specify a clientConditionalOrderId as a peer of orderToCreate in the request body.\n\nIf canceling an order is desired, provide the id of the order to cancel and the type of order (ORDER for an order on the book or CONDITIONAL_ORDER) in the orderToCancel object. This will pair the newly placed or with its target. If either conditional order triggers, the other will be cancelled. If both are trigger simultaneously, only the first conditional order place will trigger and the other will be cancelled. Note that there is not currently a way to break up two conditional orders paired in the fashion. To change the cancellation relationship, both conditional orders must be cancelled and placed again. You cannot link more than two orders in the fashion. Also note that if the orderToCancel is an order on the book and the conditional order triggers, the order on the book will be cancelled to free up funds prior to attempting to place the ordered triggered by the condition.\n\n#### Common Use Cases\n\nThis section describes some common use cases and provides instruction for how to meet them using the API:\n\n- __Stop Order__: A market order triggered by price moving past a given threshold. Specify operand and triggerPrice as desired and define a market buy or sell order in orderToCreate.\n\n- __Stop Limit Order__: A limit order triggered by price moving past a given threshold. Specify operand and triggerPrice as desired and define a limit buy or sell order in orderToCreate.\n\n- __Stop Loss Order__: A market sell order triggered by price falling to a given threshold. Specify LTE as the operand and triggerPrice as desired and define a market sell order in orderToCreate.\n\n- __Take Profit Order__: A limit sell order triggered by price rising to a given threshold. Specify GTE as the operand and triggerPrice as desired and define a limit sell order in orderToCreate.\n\n- __Trailing Stop Loss Order__: A market sell order triggered when price falls more than a given amount below the highest price seen since the order was created. Specify LTE as the operand, set trailingStopPercent as desired, and define a market sell order in orderToCreate.\n\n- __One Cancels the Other Order (OCO)__: A pair of orders where if one is triggered (for a conditional order) or executed (for an order on book) the other is automatically cancelled. When creating the second order in the pair, specify the id of the first order in orderToCancel. Note that currently one member of the OCO pair must be a conditional order.\n\nNote that more combinations are possible. These examples are intended as a guide to some common use cases, not an exhaustive list of supported scenarios.",

Begin to queue up messages without processing them\n3. Call the equivalent v3 REST API and record both the results and the value of the returned `Sequence` header. Refer to the descriptions of individual streams to find the corresponding REST API. Note that you must call the REST API with the same parameters as you used to subscribed to the stream to get the right snapshot. For example, orderbook snapshots of different depths will have different sequence numbers.\n4. If the `Sequence` header is less than the sequence number of the first queued socket message received (unlikely), discard the results of step 3 and then repeat step 3 until this check passes.\n5. Discard all socket messages where the sequence number is less than or equal to the `Sequence` header retrieved from the REST call\n6. Apply the remaining socket messages in order on top of the results of the REST call. The objects received in the socket deltas have the same schemas as the objects returned by the REST API. Each socket delta is a snapshot of an object. The identity of the object is defined by a unique key made up of one or more fields in the message (see documentation of individual streams for details). To apply socket deltas to a local cache of data, simply replace the objects in the cache with those coming from the socket where the keys match.\n7. Continue to apply messages as they are received from the socket as long as sequence number on the stream is always increasing by 1 each message (Note: for private streams, the sequence number is scoped to a single account or subaccount).\n8. If a message is received that is not the next in order, return to step 2 in this process\n\nFor applications that depend on keeping the stream of data as reliable as possible, creating multiple socket connections for redundancy is recommended. The sequence numbers published across all of the connections will be consistent with each other and can be used to determine which messages have been received.",

Each subaccount has its own deposit addresses, balances, desposits and withdrawals, orders, etc. Partners control all actions of their subaccounts via the v3 REST API and may use the v3 websocket to be notified of any updates to their balances, deposits, and orders.\n\nIn order to work with subaccounts, you must be using an API key that has subaccount permissions. Partners who are part of this program can work with their Bittrex representative to get their API key enabled.\n\nTo create a subaccount, POST to the [subaccounts](#operation--subaccounts-post) endpoint. This will create a new subaccount and return its id. Once you have a subaccount id, you can transfer funds between it and your main (master) account using the [transfers](#operation--transfers-post) endpoint. In order to place orders, view history, or take other actions in the context of a subaccount using the REST API, add the `Api-subaccount-ID` header to the request and adjust your [request signature](#topic-Authentication) as needed.\n\nTo be notified of updates to subaccount data, use a websocket connection authenticated with a subaccount enabled API key and subscribe to the subaccount streams for the types of data you care about. A single subscription will receive data from all subaccounts the API key is authorized to manage. Messaages will include an accountId field which can be used to associate them with the correct subaccount. For subaccount streams that include a sequence number for synchronizing with the server, the sequence number is independent for each subaccount."
