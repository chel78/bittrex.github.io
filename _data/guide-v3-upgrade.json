    "Getting Started": {
      "description": "Version 3 of the Bittrex API (v3) is an evolutionary step up from the previous version 1.1 (v1). Operations that API developers are accustomed to using in v1 typically have a direct corollary in the v3 api. The names of endpoints and fields may be different, but there is broad conceptual alignment across the two versions to help make v3 feel familiar to developers who have worked with the v1 API. From a client technology stack perspective, any client stack which was working with v1 should also be able to work with v3. This document provides both general high level guidance about transitioning from v1 to v3 as well as a detailed mapping of v1 operations and fields to their v3 equivalents.\n\nThese steps outline the process to upgrade from v1 to v3:\n1. Read through the [New Features](#topic-New-Features) and [General Information](#topic-General-Information) sections of this guide to gain a high level familiarity with what is new and different in v3.\n2. Take an inventory of your usage of the v1 API in your existing code base.\n    - Identify operations and data used from v1.\n    - Note easy opportunities for improvement based on the new features in v3.\n3. Use the REST API and Websocket API reference portions of this guide to map your v1 API usage to v3 equivalents.\n4. Plan your strategy for replacing v1 dependencies with their v3 equivalents\n    - _Note:_ The same engine backs both versions of the API. It is possible to use a mix of v1 and v3 operations while transitioning. Due to the interconnected nature of the v3 REST API and websocket, if a phased transition is desirable, transitioning REST & socket object by object instead of all of REST followed by all of socket may be easier. However the right decision depends on the details of your implementation.\n5. Execute your plan. Be sure to test your v3 implementation with small-value transactions to validate it prior to full production usage.\n\nIf you have questions about how something works in v3, be sure to check out the [v3 API Reference](../../../api/v3). If you have additional questions, feedback, or recommendations please post a question via our [Github page](https://github.com/Bittrex/bittrex.github.io/issues)."

The mechanisms for their use are somewhat different.\n\nIn the REST API the process for signing request is similar to that of v1, but now also requires a hash of the request body content where applicable. Refer to the [REST Authentication](../../../#topic-Authentication) documentation for details.\n\nAuthentication in the v3 websocket no longer requires getting an auth context prior to authenticating. Instead it uses a client-generated uuid in place of a server generated challenge. It also requires authentication to be renewed periodically for the client to remain subscribed to private streams.Refer to the [Authenticating](../../../api/v3#topic-Authenticating) topic in the v3 websocket documentation for additional information."

    "Error Handling": {
      "childOf": "General Information",
      "description": "The v1 API included a flag in response bodies indicating if there was an error along with an error code. Error handling in v3 uses HTTP error codes instead of a flag inside of the response body. Details may be found [here](../../../api/v3/#topic-Error-Codes). In the case of an error, a detailed error code and potentially additional information will be included in the response body. In general, a 4XX series error indicates that the client was at fault (e.g. malformed request, insufficient balance, etc.) while a 5XX series error indicates a server-side issue."
    },
    "Placing Orders": {
      "childOf": "General Information",
      "description": "In v3 there are no longer separate endpoints for buy and sell orders. Order placement has been centralized into [POST /orders](../../../api/v3/#operation--orders-post) for orders that execute or are placed on the orderbook immediately and [POST /conditional-orders](../../../api/v3/#operation--conditional-orders-post) for orders that may execute later based on a condition being met (e.g. stop orders). Conditional orders do not currently have an equivalent in the v1 API so the remainder of this section is focused on regular orders.\n\nImprovements to order placement and management are one area where the v3 API has significant advantages over the v1 API. In addition to supporting many more types of orders, the v3 API supports setting a `clientOrderId` when placing an order. This id is used as an idempotency key. If reused for order creation within 24 hours, the request will fail with a reference to the existing order. The `clientOrderId` is stored with created orders forever, but it is no longer enforced after 24 hours.\n\nAnother important advantage of the v3 API is that when orders are created or cancelled, the response body will include the current state of the order. This means that it is no longer necessary in v3 to get the order state immediately after placement or cancellation to see what happened when the order hit the book or to get its final state after cancellation.\n\nThe configuration options when placing an order have been moved into the body of the [POST /orders](../../../api/v3/#operation--orders-post) request. The table below contains a mapping of v1 query parameters to v3 order request fields.\n\n| v1&nbsp;Query&nbsp;Parameter | v3&nbsp;NewOrder&nbsp;Field | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n||direction|In v1 the endpoint determined buy vs. sell. In v3 this is an enum (BUY, SELL)|\n||type|In v1 only limit orders were supported. In v3 there are a number of different order types. Set `type` to LIMIT for a limit order.|\n|market|marketSymbol|Market symbols are reversed in v3 to align with standard forex conventions|\n|quantity|quantity||\n|rate|limit||\n|timeInForce|timeInForce|In v1 this could be GTC or IOC. In v3 the equivalent values are GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED and IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL. FILL_OR_KILL is also supported in v3.|\n\n_Additional fields are available in the v3 model that have no equivalent in v1. Refer to the [NewOrder](../../../api/v3/#definition-NewOrder) schema definition for details._"
    },
    "Websocket Subscriptions": {
      "childOf": "General Information",
      "description": "The technical underpinnings of the v3 socket are unchanged from v1. It is still based on [Microsoft ASP.net SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/getting-started/tutorial-getting-started-with-signalr) which should make it easy to transition any existing v1 websocket client implementations to v3. However there are some conceptual differences around subscriptions and message handling.\n\nIn v3, subsciptions are arranged around types of resources in the same way that the v3 REST API is organized. For example there is a [/balances endpoint](../../../api/v3/#tag-balances) that can be used to retrieve [Balance](../../../api/v3/#definition-Balance) objects. For live updates to balances, you subscribe to the [Balance stream](../../../api/v3/#method-Balance). Once subscribed, when one of your currency balances changes, you will receive a message with a snapshot of the new balance for that currency. The schema of the payload of that update will be a [Balance](../../../api/v3/#definition-Balance) object just like what is retrieved from the REST API. It will also include a sequence number (the v3 equivalent of a nonce) that matches a sequence number returned in the `sequence` response header from the [GET /balances](../../../api/v3/#operation--balances-get). This allows usage of the REST API and websocket in concert to maintain a local cache of balance data. All v3 websocket streams follow this general pattern for [synchronization](../../../api/v3/#topic-Synchronizing).\n\nAdditional in v3, websocket messages are no longer minified so there is no need for a mapping table in order to interpret them. Messages are compressed though so decompression is still required before consumption."
